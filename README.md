# ConnectBus
Connect Bus is a web-based platform designed to simplify bus booking by connecting drivers and users efficiently. Drivers can register on the platform by providing their details, including name, contact number, bus type, and capacity. Users can then search for available buses by specifying their source and destination. The platform displays relevant bus options along with driver details, such as bus type, capacity, driver name, and contact number. This project aims to enhance accessibility to bus services, making the booking process more convenient for both drivers and users. The repository includes the source code, documentation, and setup instructions for deploying the Connect Bus website.
